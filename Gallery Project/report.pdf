HOW TO INSTALL, INITIALIZE AND RUN DATABASE AND SERVER:
- Download dependancies specified in the package.json file
- run node server.js in your termial, this runs the database as well and inputs default users and the artwork from the gallery.json file
    using the database-initalizer.js file
- when the collections are dropped and the default values are put in, it should print 'connected um successfully' for each collection(twice)
- once the previous line has gone through then we are can now put in localhost:3000 in our web browser and begin surfing.

OVERALL DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION QUALITY
- I used request for each page and status codes to tranfer information from my client to my server
- I did not use routers even though it would have been a lot better to work with because I kept running into 
    errors because of them and did not want to waste too much time. And having all my requests in the same server file
    helped me to keep track of what I was doing and was easier for me to debug
- I used the client side javascript to send some requests to links to help me edit the visual side of th pug file
    like when the user does not input a value in a textbox and I colour the borders red and output a messesge
- I used asynchronous operations for all of my requests as it was neccessary to use await, which was beneficial when I wanted to do anything involving 
    databases
- I implemented proper error handling but having a page that was rendered when a user tried to access a page but was not already
    loggedin and this page had a button the redirected them to the login page and was implemedted in every of my pages
-I assigned my req.seesion.loggedin to my user's name to keep track of who was logged in as using true or false could apply to every user
    and was not very specific
- if a user tried to go the register page or login page while already logged in, they where redirected to their explore page

INTERFACE QUALITY
- i implemented bootstrap for my navigation bar to help with it being ajusted according to the window size
- The items on my screen are able to handle different window sizes
- I have a link in my header to help my user move to which ever page they needed to go to
